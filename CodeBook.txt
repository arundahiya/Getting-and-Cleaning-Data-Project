Summary

This is an assignment for The Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course offered by Johns Hopkins.

The objective of the assignment was to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Code Walk-through

The code from the Run_analysis.R file creates a function Run_analysis() which

Sets up the environment by loading the dplyr library
Imports the following data files:
X_train.txt and X_test.txt which have the feature data from each of the 30 subjects
subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt which list the subject tested in the same order as the training data
y_train.txt and y_test.txt which list the subject tested as a number in the same order as the training data
features.txt which lists each feature tested in the data files (used as the column headers for the data)
activity_labels.txt which has the desciption of each activity listed in the y-train and y-test files
Adds column names to test and train data using the features file
Extracts mean and standard deviation variables for each of the features using the dplyr 'select' function
Combines the mean and standard deviation data for the training and test data sets
Adds information about the subject and the activities (numeric) using 'cbind' to both data sets
Combines the test and train data in to one large data set
Adds descriptive activity names to the second column of the data using factors
Makes the relevant data numeric for grouping and summarizing purposes
Groups (group_by) and summarizes (summarise_each) the data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
returns the tidy data set of averages
Code Book Variables

The datafile SummaryData.txt includes the following variables:

Subject: which of the 30 volunteers the observation pertains to

Activity: which of the 6 activities the observation records

Averages of mean and standard deviation for each of the features from the initial study:
